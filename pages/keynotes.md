## Opportunities in the midst of challenges (Ali Tizghadam)

 DevOps journey has been a challenging yet fascinating experience for different organizations. In this talk we zoom into DevOps practices in Telco domain, the challenges we have faced in TELUS as a Telecommunications service provider and the opportunities arose. The talk will explore the shifts we had to experience in architecture, processes, mindset, execution, and daily operations habits, together with the role of abstraction, models and automation in addressing the challenges.

Dr Ali Tizghadam is Principal Technology Architect at [TELUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telus) (the 2nd largest telco operator in Canada) since 2013, and Senior Research Associate at the University of Toronto since 2012. After his M.Sc. degree in Tehran (1994), he graduated from the University of Toronto (PhD) in 2009.

## Three real world uses cases of AI operationalization to illustrate AI DevOps challenge (Eric Charton)

Widely recognized and promoted DevOps methodologies or tools used to push AI systems in production are not a 100% recipe for success. With three use cases as an illustration, we will explain how the question of change management can be much more important than the DevOps framework to successfully deploy in production. The three uses cases we will use as an illustration are real life ones: introducing state of the art research in a high traffic search engine, deploying successfully and multiple time an open source dialog platform in a bank, and delivering a new machine learning based risk modelling algorithm. Those use cases were applied in various industries (banking, media), between 2016 and now.

Dr Eric Charton is Senior Director (AI Science) at the [National Bank of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bank_of_Canada). He graduated from _Universit√© d'Avignon et des Pays du Vaucluse_ (M.Sc. -- 2007, Ph.D. -- 2010).
