# DevOps Challenges in an SDN Context --- a Vendor Perspective

## Abstract

Discussions about what DevOps is and how to follow it often ignore the context in which development and operations are carried out.  The presentation will argue that these contexts can have significant impact on the DevOps process and practice. In particular, it will focus on the unique relationship between the vendor of a software-defined networking (SDN) solution and a network operator. The impact of this relationship on the DevOps process will be discussed by reviewing some of the DevOps best practices as identified Google Cloud's DORA team, and highlighting those practices whose realization is most challenging in this context.
