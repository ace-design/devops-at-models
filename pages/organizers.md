## Organizers

**Francis Bordeleau** is Professor at _École de Technologie Supérieure_ (ETS) in Montréal. He is currently working on establishing of an industry research chair, which includes the development on new course, on DevOps. He has over 25 years of experience in software and model-based engineering (MBE); researching, working, consulting, and collaborating with companies worldwide. Prior to joining ETS, he was the founder of Cmind (2017-), product manager of SW Development at Ericsson (2013-2017), founder and CEO of Zeligsoft (2003-2013), director of Tooling Business for PrismTech (2010-2013), and assistant professor at Carleton University (1997-2006). Francis has been part of the organizing and program committee of many international conferences and workshops, including MODELS,ICSE, ECMFA, DevOps@MODELS'19, MDETools, PAINS, OSS4MDE, and MiSE.

**Juergen Dingel** is Professor in the School of Computing at Queen's University.  His research is centered around the development and use of informal and formal techniques for the analysis of software artifacts.  Juergen was co-organizer of the following MODELS  workshops: DevOps@MODELS'19, MDETools'17-'19, OSS4MDE'14-'16, AMT'12-'15, and MASE'15, the Workshop on Software Modeling for Embedded and Sensor Network Systems at CASCON'11, PC co-chair of the FMOODS/FORTE'11 conference and the DEBS'05 workshop, Workshop co-chair for MODELS'10, and Chair of the Doctoral Symposium at MODELS'09.
