# DevOps et Models 2021

## Important dates

  - Submission Deadline: July 30, 2021
  - Notification: August 14-21, 2021
  - Camera-ready versions: August 28, 2021
  - Workshop date: TBA

## Expected Contributions

All submitted artifacts must use English. All textual documents must adhere to the guidelines provided by the main conference with respect to IEEE template. 

For this year, we want to promote a workshop based on more discussions than paper presentation, to avoid the "mini-conference" bias. Thus, we encourage two types of submissions : _(1)_ papers (5 to 10 IEEE pages) describing work-in progress contributions to the challenges (that will be included in the proceedings), and _(2)_ short abstract (200 words) gathering thoughts about the participants with respect to the identified challenges.

  * Work-in-progress contributions (5 to 10 pages): papers addressing relevant experience reports, challenges, trends, and opportunities (see the [About page](../about/) for topics of interests) are particularly encouraged.
  * Abstract-contributions (extended abstract of 200 words): Participants are encouraged to provide a short abstract where they state their interests and potential contributions to the workshop. They can also propose research challenges related to the theme. Industrial contributions are particularly welcomed in this category.

To submit a paper, use the following EasyChair submission site: [https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=devopsmodels21](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=devopsmodels21)
