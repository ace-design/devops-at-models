# DevOps@Models 2021

## Important dates

  - Submission Deadline: July 30, 2021
  - Notification: August 21, 2021
  - Camera-ready versions: August 28, 2021
  - Workshop date: TBA

## Expected Contributions

All submitted artifacts must be in PDF, be written in English, and use 
the IEEE manuscript template for conference proceedings, available at 
[https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)

For this year, we want to promote a workshop based on more discussions 
than paper presentation, to avoid the "mini-conference" bias. Thus, we 
encourage two types of submissions:

1. **Results and work-in-progress contributions** (5 to 10 pages): papers 
describing relevant results, experience reports, challenges, trends, 
and opportunities (see the About page for topics of interests) are 
particularly encouraged.
2. **Abstract contributions** (extended abstract of 200 words): 
participants are encouraged to provide a short abstract in which they 
state their interests and potential contributions to the workshop. 
They can also propose research challenges related to the theme. 
Industrial contributions are particularly welcomed in this category.

Accepted results and work-in-progress contributions will be included 
in the workshop proceedings. For accepted abstract contributions, 
inclusion of a joint description will be considered.

To submit a paper, use the following EasyChair submission site:
