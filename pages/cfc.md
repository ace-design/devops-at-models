For this 2020 edition, we want to move from the "mini-conference" format to a more interactive workshop.  To encourage this atmosphere of discussions and brainstorming, we are encouraging participants to submit short presentations of their work.

  * Work-in-progress contributions (5 to 10 pages): papers addressing relevant experience reports, challenges, trends, and opportunities (see the [About page](../about/) for topics of interests) are particularly encouraged.
  * Abstract-contributions (extended abstract of 2 pages): Participants are encouraged to provide a short abstract where they state their interests and potential contributions to the workshop. They can also propose research challenges related to the theme. Industrial contributions are particularly welcomed in this category.

The work-in-progress papers will be included in the proceedings.

To submit a paper, use the following EasyChair submission site: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=devopsmodels20](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=devopsmodels20)
