## Important dates

  - Notification: August 19, 2022
  - Camera-ready versions: August 26, 2022
  - Workshop date: TBA (23-25 October)

## Topics

We are expecting contributions related to the following topics:

  - Modeling for social good (MODELS 2022 theme)
  - Modelling for DevOps
  - DevOps for Modelling

For a detailed description of each topic, with associated research questions, see the [About page](../about)

## Expected Contributions

All submitted artifacts must be in PDF, be written in English, and use 
the formating template of the main conference ([Technical track guidelines](https://conf.researchr.org/track/models-2022/models-2022-technical-track#About))

For this year, we want to promote a workshop based on more discussions 
than paper presentation, to avoid the "mini-conference" bias. Thus, we 
encourage two types of submissions:

1. **Results and work-in-progress contributions** (5 to 10 pages): papers  describing relevant results, experience reports, challenges, trends, 
and opportunities (see the About page for topics of interests) are particularly encouraged.
2. **Abstract contributions** (extended abstract of 200 words): participants are encouraged to provide a short abstract in which they state their interests and potential contributions to the workshop. They can also propose research challenges related to the theme. Industrial contributions are particularly welcomed in this category.

Accepted results and work-in-progress contributions will be included in the workshop proceedings. The organizers will summarize all the abstract and the associated discussions in a comprehensive report that will be included in the proceedings.
