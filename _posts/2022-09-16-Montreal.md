## Accepted Contributions

  - Johan Bergelin and Antonio Cicchetti: **Towards continuous modelling to enable DevOps: a preliminary study with practitioners**
    - _Model-based methods and techniques continuously evolve to meet the increasing challenges of modern-day technical landscapes. Parallel to Model-based methods, different paradigms are similarly maturing and being integrated, and one such paradigm is DevOps. Model-based methods and DevOps are perceived to contain benefits when viewed in isolation. Recently there has been an increased interest in matching the two paradigms, with various proposals and early adoption results. However, little focus is put on the practitioners’ view. In this paper, we propose a methodology currently being integrated which aims to utilize Model-driven engineering and DevOps practices in conjunction. Further, we present an early evaluation of our proposed methodology from a practitioner perspective, employing a large and long-running student project aiming to build a solar vehicle as a case, presenting the current integration and potential future directions. Early observations from the case study indicate significant benefits for several identified project pain points, and it’s expected that more benefits will emerge when more advanced DevOps aspects are integrated with model-based methods, and the project matures._

    - _DevOps and Model Driven Engineering (MDE) provide differently skilled IT stakeholders with  methodologies and tools for organizing and automating continuous software engineering activities and using models as key engineering artifacts. JSON is a popular data format, and JSON Schema provides a general purpose schema language for JSON. This paper presents our work in progress on blended modeling and scenario simulation of continuous delivery pipelines as executable JSON-based models. For this purpose, we show a case study based on Keptn, an open source tool for DevOps automation of cloud-native applications, and its language Shipyard, a JSON-based process language for continuous delivery pipeline specification._
