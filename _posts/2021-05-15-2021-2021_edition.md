* **Modeling for Human-AI Collaborative Society**:
    - How can DevOps support AI development from an MDE point of view?
    - How can modelling approaches support the integration of data in a DevOps approach (\emph{e.g.}, digital twins)?
    - Can modelling help the design of scalable (in terms of data) DevOps approaches? 
    - How can models contribute to the integration of new data sources in an open-data context?
